# Build a TJBot using Watson Services to talk about sports

In this developer journey we will build a TJBot that knows baseball. Using 
Watson Discovery, TJBot will give you insight about your favorite teams, such as
their current league standing, their upcoming shedule, and links to a few
relevant articles from Watson News.

When the reader has completed this journey, they will understand how to:

* Build a TJBot that converses using Watson Conversation
* Use Watson Text to Speech and Speech to Text services to converse with TJBot
* Use Watson Tone Analyzer to determine your sentiment about your favorite teams
* Use Watson Discovery News to find news articles about your favorite teams 
* Query 3rd party data sources to get the latest Major League Baseball (MLB) data
* Use Twilio to send SMS text messages with team schedules and news article links

# Privacy Notice

If using the Deploy to Bluemix button some metrics are tracked, the following
information is sent to a [Deployment Tracker](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/cf-deployment-tracker-service) service
on each deployment:

* Python package version
* Python repository URL
* Application Name (application_name)
* Application GUID (application_id)
* Application instance index number (instance_index)
* Space ID (space_id)
* Application Version (application_version)
* Application URIs (application_uris)
* Labels of bound services
* Number of instances for each bound service and associated plan information

This data is collected from the setup.py file in the sample application and the ``VCAP_APPLICATION``
and ``VCAP_SERVICES`` environment variables in IBM Bluemix and other Cloud Foundry platforms. This
data is used by IBM to track metrics around deployments of sample applications to IBM Bluemix to
measure the usefulness of our examples, so that we can continuously improve the content we offer
to you. Only deployments of sample applications that include code to ping the Deployment Tracker
service will be tracked.

## Disabling Deployment Tracking

To disable tracking, simply remove ``cf_deployment_tracker.track()`` from the
``run.py`` file in the top level directory.
